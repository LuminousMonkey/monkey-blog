title: Should have used CVS

It seems that I lost all my old blog data, I thought I had saved the SQL database (I was using Wordpress previously). But I can't find it, whoops, that's a few years of blogging lost.

Maybe I'll check the [Internet Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/), and recover anything that seems interesting from there.
