#+title: Quick Post
#+date: 2015-10-18

This is just a quick post, so I can keep my trend of a blog post a day. It's currently 9:47am and I'm about to go to a circus with the family, so I don't think I can get a good post in before lunch.

However, I've been wanted to write a post on a few things, that maybe I will get around to doing:

* Post ideas
  - The crappy state of Greentree.
  - Small business in general.
  - Running a small business is hard.
  - Habits.

We'll see how I go.
