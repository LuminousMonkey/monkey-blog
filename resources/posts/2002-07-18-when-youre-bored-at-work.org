10 points for anyone who reads this AND tells me the artist and song:

#+begin_quote
I can’t see ever feeling right again
I’m on a raft in a river that’s roaring away with me
What good does it do me to have what I want
When I’m in no shape to enjoy what I have
#+end_quote

And to make the search easier (sif it isn't really easy already) here's another:

#+begin_quote
So I found out your reasons
For the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts and I’m lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
So it’s time to leave
You see this meant everything to me
#+end_quote

Now the really hard question, what movie was one of this artists songs in? (Hint: It was a nightclub scene, and the movie has the quote That’s a very expensive glass of Chardonnay you’re NOT drinking there.)
