#+tags: Kittens Pointless

Yesterday (well Sunday night by the time this is posted) our cat (Mars) decided that it was time to squirt out the kittens she had been storing for the last couple of weeks. Would be the first time I saw anything like it, chickens have the right idea, use an egg, it's a damn sight less messy.

Anyway I do have some pictures of her giving birth to the little blighters (Two of which have already been named Jip, and Moff).

I don't actually have any pictures of the kittens as they are now (dry and fuzzy) so you'll have to make do with the wet and gunky pics, just be thankful I didn't think to take pictures of her eating afterbirth [fn:1].

[fn:1] Actually I did think about it, but I imagine people would've found it disgusting.
