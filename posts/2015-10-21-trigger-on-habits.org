#+title: Trigger on Habits
#+date: <2010-10-21 Thu>

Damn it all, I missed another blog post again, I'll have to do two
today. I missed out because I don't really have a good consistent
trigger to get the habit of posting started. This is a problem if my
routine changes, this happened yesterday and Monday. It's something
I'll have to work on, maybe making it something I do first thing in
the morning when I get into work, or into Uni.
