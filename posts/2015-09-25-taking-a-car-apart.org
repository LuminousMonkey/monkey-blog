#+title: Taking a car apart
#+date: <2015-09-25 Fri>

I got rear-ended a few weeks ago now, I liked my car so much that I
went out and got the exact model again. I had the option to purchase
back the wreck, which I did, so now I have a complete car of spare
parts (except for the boot obviously).

I've been slowly taking it apart, and boy, you won't believe the gunk
you can find.
