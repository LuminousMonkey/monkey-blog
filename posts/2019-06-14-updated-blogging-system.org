#+title: Updated Blogging System
#+date: <2019-06-14 Fri>

So, I've updated to a new static blog generator. This one is purely
Emacs only, still using Org-mode, the idea being that if I make it
easier, I should be able to blog more often.

I've said this before, so, I'm really not confident I'll stick with
it, this has been something I've been struggling with for years. Have
to work out what I'm going to do about it.
